# Lunar-Blast-x86-

## x86 Coal Assembly Language Project

This project contains a simple **x86 Coal Assembly Language** program that implements the game mechanics of a **space invaders shooting spaceship**. It is composed of two main files:

- `blast.asm` — the main assembly language source code file.
- `Makefile` — a build script to compile and link the assembly code.

## Features

- Simple game mechanics based on space invaders using assembly language.
- Written for **x86 architecture**.
- The program can be compiled and run on systems that support **x86 assembly**.

## Requirements

To build and run the program, you need the following software installed:

- **MASM** (Microsoft Macro Assembler) — An assembler for x86 architecture.
- **Linker (LINK)** — For linking the object file produced by MASM.

You can install these tools by downloading **MASM** from the official Microsoft site, or if you're on **Windows**, you can use **Visual Studio** to get MASM and its associated tools.

## Files

- `blast.asm`: The assembly code for the project.
- `Makefile`: The build script to automate the assembly, linking, and execution steps.

## Steps to Run the Code
